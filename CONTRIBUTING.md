## What this repository is?

This repository does not contain new architecture styles. Rather it contains common solutions architecture patterns found in enterprise software systems. If you have a solutions architecture pattern which you think as important for others and can share, you can contribute to this repository. 

## Few ideas on contributions

- It would be nice if you could draw a diagram which explains the architecture since that diagram can speaks for 1000 words you write in the description
- Having a description would make it ever better
- If you are looking for a certain solutions architecture pattern for your project, create an issue so that people who has the knowledge on that subject can send us a PR
