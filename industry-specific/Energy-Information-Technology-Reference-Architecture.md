## Introduction
Urbanization is bringing more and more people to cities. The technological advancements in consumer electronics make more and more people use those devices than ever before.   It makes the demand for energy keeps increasing. Even though renewable energy is becoming more and more usable and cost-effective, it is yet to fulfill the continuity requirement of energy demand. Building more and more traditional energy-producing plants (e.g. coal) is impacting “climate change”. We should reduce the carbon footprint. It is a quite complicated problem to solve. At the same time, it is not something that we can keep aside. As technologists, what can we do to save the world?

Let’s try to break down this complicated problem into a set of requirements and try to work on those items as much we can from the technology perspective. Given below is a list of requirements in the energy industry that we can address through the application of technology. 

- Growing energy demand
- Measuring the impact on the environment
- Give customers control of their energy consumption
- Improve the quality of service and provide a continuous supply with minimum outages

With all the details in hand, let’s try to build a solid technical architecture that can support most (if not all) of the requirements mentioned above. 

## Technical Reference Architecture
Building a solution architecture requires identifying the main building blocks and how they are interconnected. Based on the information provided in the previous sections, here are the main components that need to be included in the solution architecture. 

- Integration - This is critical to connecting various components that are required for business operations like asset management, customer management, etc. It makes sure that systems are well integrated through data and necessary insights are generated to take key business decisions. It also helps to improve business efficiency and customer experience through timely access to data. 
- API Management - Once the data is integrated and processed, that information needs to be exposed to internal and external consumers through secured channels. Having an API gateway allows exposing critical business data to different types of users through different channels in a secure manner. It also allows automating the manual interactions with 3rd party service providers and customers.
- Event broker - This component is required to collect all the real-time events coming from various hardware sensors and devices (smart meters) so that real-time decisions can be made and insights can be generated for various business operations. It also helps to deliver real-time notifications to customers and field operations teams to act accordingly and provide a better customer experience. 
- Real-time event processor - Once the events are collected by the event broker, those events need to be processed in real-time to make critical business decisions. In addition to real-time decision making and publishing, this component also generates actionable insights based on data within a given duration (e.g. hourly, daily, monthly, etc.). 
- ERP software - Enterprise Resource Planning is a critical aspect of managing the energy generation, transmission, and distribution processes with a lot of enterprise assets involved. 
- CRM software - Customer Relationship Management is another key aspect of operating an energy company that involves direct customer interactions. This component manages the customer relationship with the company while integrating with internal systems through the integration layer. 
- Identity and Access Management - Securing all the different applications and systems in a unified manner is essential to provide a better customer experience while protecting the business data and customer trust. This component is capable of providing that functionality. 

In addition to these main components, there can be 10s of other systems like device management software (MDM), HR management software (HRIS), etc. to support various parts of the operations within the organization. The below figure depicts how these components are laid out to build the solution architecture.

As depicted in the above figure, “Integration Layer” is the main component that integrates disparate systems that are required to execute various business processes and make sure that data is transferred in a swift manner. This functionality is called the “ESB” or “Integration” in most cases. It makes sure that systems are connected as and when required with minimum effort or customization on those systems. Based on the requirements of a particular organization, the same layer provides the functionality to implement long-running business processes with human interactions with BPM tools. 

The “API Management Layer” exposes the data that needs to exposed to internal and external users with security and control. These users can use different channels to interact with data through this layer. As an example, the operations center of the organization will use their interactive website to connect through WebSockets to listen to real-time notifications about system failures while energy consumers will use their mobile applications to check the current month’s energy usage. It also helps when interacting with various regulatory, compliance bodies and makes sure that processes are well integrated and maintained with the necessary access and auditing capabilities. 

The “Identity and Access Management” layer is responsible for securing the data from fraudulent access and also makes life easier for the internal users to access multiple systems with a single login using Single-Sign-On capabilities. In addition to that, it also helps to implement advanced security for consumer access with Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA) schemes. 

One of the critical aspects of providing a continuous service is to keep monitoring every aspect of the energy generation, transmission, and distribution with proper tools. In addition to that, the consumer side also needs to be monitored. That is the functionality of various devices used at different locations within the grid and those devices generate millions of events every minute. These events need to be collected and processed in real-time to identify any abnormal behaviors in the grid and the distribution network. That is the task of the event broker and the real-time event processing components which are mentioned in the above figure.

The above figure provides a strong foundation to build an effective IT ecosystem for the energy industry. This architecture can be implemented with various software components available in the market. 

## Future improvements
The above architecture can be expanded to support modern requirements like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing with the usage of appropriate technologies. As an example, AI and ML related functionalities can be integrated with the event broker and real-time event processing components easily. All the required integration points are available for such improvements to the system. Given this architecture is independent of any particular vendor or specific technology, users can use their preferred cloud vendor that offers these basic functional components with their offering. The good news for such users is that most of the major public cloud vendors provide these functional capabilities as cloud services.
